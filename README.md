# linear-algebra

I'm implementing my own functions about some linear algebra concepts while I'm following this course [Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/index.htm) and this book: [Introduction to Linear Algebra](http://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/), Fifth Edition (2016).   
  
The structure of the project is:  
  
* **concepts**: exploring some theoretical concepts with R.  
  
* **r-things**: some ways to do things in R  
  
* **functions**: my own functions about some linear algebra concepts.  
```vector_functions.R```: Some functions about vectors.  
  
    * **test**: test scripts of functions files.
